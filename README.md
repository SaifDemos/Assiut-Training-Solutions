# 💻 Assiut University Training - Newcomers Sheets Solutions

> This repository contains the accepted solutions for the programming problems found in the **Assiut University Training - Newcomers Sheets**, a curriculum designed to build a strong foundation in problem-solving and competitive programming fundamentals.

**🔗 Official Problem Source:**
[Assiut University Training - Newcomers Contests on Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contests)

## ⚠️ Important Language Note

> The original Assiut University Training sheets are primarily designed to be solved using **C/C++**.
> 
> **In this project, however, we are focusing exclusively on providing solutions in **Java**.**
> 
> We are considering adding C++ solutions in a future major update or creating a separate dedicated C++ repository. Contributions for alternative languages are welcome!

## 🎯 Goal of the Project

The primary goal of this collaborative repository is to:

1.  **Solve and Document:** Provide accurate, efficient, and well-explained solutions in **Java** for all problems across the 10 training sheets, sourced from the official **Codeforces group contests**.
2.  **Facilitate Learning:** Serve as a valuable reference and study resource for students from Assiut University and others following the curriculum.
3.  **Practice Collaboration:** Provide a real-world environment for our group to practice Git, GitHub, and code review processes.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized logically by sheet, and then by problem identifier to ensure easy navigation and maintainability.

Each problem is contained in its own folder, and the Java file inside is named to match the public class (typically based on the problem title).
## 📈 Sheets Progress Overview

This table tracks the overall progress across all the Newcomers Sheets.

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from friends and fellow students! To contribute a solution or improve an existing one, please follow the standard GitHub workflow:

1.  **Fork** or **Clone** this repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your solution (e.g., `feat/sheet3-problemA`).
3.  Add your Java solution file in the correct directory: `/Sheet_XX/Problem_XX_Title/YourSolution.java`.
4.  Commit your changes, push the branch, and open a **Pull Request (PR)**.
5.  **Update the README:** Please ensure you update the following sections in `README.md` within your Pull Request:
    * **"Sheets Progress Overview":** Increment the **Solved** count for the relevant sheet. Update the **Status** emoji (e.g., from ❌ to ⏳ if started to handle a full sheet, or ❌ to ✅ if completed the problem\sheet).
    * **"Detailed Sheet Solutions":** Add the problem title and the link to your new solution file in the correct sheet table. Change the Status emoji for that problem to ✅.

Solutions must be correctly formatted, adhere to Java conventions, and pass all required test cases.
