# 💻 Assiut University Training - Newcomers Sheets Solutions

> This repository contains the accepted solutions for the programming problems found in the **Assiut University Training - Newcomers Sheets**, a curriculum designed to build a strong foundation in problem-solving and competitive programming fundamentals.

**🔗 Official Problem Source:**
[Assiut University Training - Newcomers Contests on Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contests)

## ⚠️ Important Language Note

> The original Assiut University Training sheets are primarily designed to be solved using **C/C++**.
> 
> **In this project, however, we are focusing exclusively on providing solutions in **Java**.**
> 
> We are considering adding C++ solutions in a future major update or creating a separate dedicated C++ repository. Contributions for alternative languages are welcome!

## 🎯 Goal of the Project

The primary goal of this collaborative repository is to:

1.  **Solve and Document:** Provide accurate, efficient, and well-explained solutions in **Java** for all problems across the 10 training sheets, sourced from the official **Codeforces group contests**.
2.  **Facilitate Learning:** Serve as a valuable reference and study resource for students from Assiut University and others following the curriculum.
3.  **Practice Collaboration:** Provide a real-world environment for our group to practice Git, GitHub, and code review processes.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized logically by sheet, and then by problem identifier to ensure easy navigation and maintainability.

Each problem is contained in its own folder, and the Java file inside is named to match the public class (typically based on the problem title).

## 🔍 Solutions and Progress Status

All detailed solution links and the current completion status for every sheet (Sheet 01 through Sheet 10) are tracked in a dedicated file.
